# Bash Igniter


Bash Igniter is an application where you can create Controllers, Models, Views, Routes and other components with cli for your project in **CodeIgniter 3**.

## How to install?

To install is very simple, just go to the folder of your project in CodeIgniter 3 and type:

`composer require omarkdev/bash-igniter`


Right after you install the dependency with Composer, you must download the igniter and put it in your project folder. For this you can do the following:

You can download with PHP, running this command:

`php -r "copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarkdev/igniter/master/igniter', 'igniter');"`

Or with wget running this command:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omarkdev/igniter/master/igniter`

Or access the repository and download it in your project folder:

[https://github.com/omarkdev/igniter/](https://github.com/omarkdev/igniter/)

Soon after performing these two steps, you are **ready to use bash-igniter**.
